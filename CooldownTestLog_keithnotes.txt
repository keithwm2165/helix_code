#First is to describe from the wiki what wwas setup  before the readout started( first measurment from Whisper data is November 10th 9:50pm (log under Cooldown tests has this line in it "Setup magnet pressure sensors to be readout over night ").

#First log is November 8th (Cooling the magnet with LN2). 
#The Whisper Flow Meter data used here is after the initial cool down of the magnet system with LN2. 
#"stack relief pressure valve is 1PSI " at 13:10
# Pressure reading from the magnet is at 2.5 PSI 
# Minigoose sensors were installed onto the magnet skin in 6 different locations
#See "pressure in magnet is reading" multiple times

#unixtime(s)  event
Whisper data starts at Friday November 10th 9:50PM ET time from unix timestamp
Timestampe is 1510368615.18
Need to subtract from every time element this timestamp above to get to seconds after test started. 


Whisper data ends Tuesday November 21st at 3:46PM ET time from unix timestamp

Dewar Levels from wiki: also have them from csv files

Notable events within flowmeter data:

 is Nov CT 
 is Nov 11th 17:10 CT started ramping magnet (choice 1)
 is Nov 11th 18:51 CT started ramping magnet (choice 2)
 is Nov 11th 20:04 CT 0V across magent taps, power supply off? persistance switch "ON"
 is Nov 12th 11:57 CT starting to top off magnet and plumbing installed
 is Nov 12th 12:09 CT started transferring LHe.
 is Nov 12th 12:54 CT stopped transfer, full.
1510520760 is Nov 12th 15:06 CT stopped transfrring LHe.
1510527583 is Nov 12th 16:59 ramping started
1510854954 is Nov 16th 11:56 (55 is when topping off started but Whisper was recorded during this time). 


This should be a good time as the start for the integration


Liquid Helium weight that fills the dewar is about 68.75 lbs or 31.25 kg
Time to charge the magnet. Power supply at 5V and Inductor of ~200H for current from 0 to 75A, then power supply at 3V for 75 to 91A. Total time ~1 hour. 

This weight is not necessarily all boiled off in the middle of the test. However, the Whisper data observes the magnet (which is topped off after turned off) from Nov 16th 11:55 to end of Whisper data maybe?

Also, it looks like topping off procedure on Nov 16th at 11:55 (1510854900) has recorded dewar weights. 
Therefore, if the topping off procedure before that was from Nov 12th,
then we have Nov 12th -16th boiled off a known amount in weight of dewar and can look at flow meters also!
