* Shield and stack outputs were closed
* The stack relief pressure valve is 1PSI 
'''13:18'''
* Pressure reading form the magnet is at 2.5 PSI
'''13:23'''
* 1PSI relief valve was taken off 
'''14:49'''
* The 1 inch stack relief valve hole has developed a nice plume
'''15:55'''
* Noticed that the Magnet power supply has the wrong plug (ordered an adapter)
'''16:20'''
* Dewar started whistling 
* Detached the dewar and went to refill it 
* Installed Minigoose sensors onto the magnet skin in 6 different locations 
'''17:08'''
* Attached the refilled LN2 Dewar and started pushing LN2 again. 
'''19:45'''
* Removed LN2 fill tube from the stack 
* Plugged the distant fill hole used for LN2 (Needed to replace the O-ring on the port)
* Opened valves to allow flow through the flow meters after the stack and shield and reinstalled the 1PSI relief valve for the stack 
'''20:11''' 
* Switch the stack relief valve from 1PSI to 5PSI to allow gas to flow out of the flow meter relief valve which is also ~1PSI.
* Shut stack vent flow meter to allow all flow over the shield 
'''20:25'''
* Magnet was left to sit over night with all exhaust flowing over the shield 
* Pressure in the magnet is reading 1.6 PSI 


[++November 9th (Flushing the LN2 and Filling with LHe)++]

'''08:45''' 
Arrived 
* Checked the flow meter : 4.83 SLPM 
* Pressure in magnet is still 1.6 PSI
'''09:00'''
* Setup up the gas lines to flush the magnet with N2 gas and push the LN2 out. 
** Took relief valve off and attached the Dewar to the farside fill port again 
** Opened the vent output on the LN2 Dewar 
** Fill tubes when pushed in full have 2 inches of small tube sticking out 
** Attached gas line to the near side input 
'''09:15'''
* Attached regulator to the N2 gas cylinder and ran gas pipe to it
* Set regulator to 5PSI output and opened up the flow valves
* Flow out shows Helium CFH 75 (note there is not N2 reading on the flow meter)
'''09:31'''
* Increased regulator output to 10PSI
* Flow is now at Helium CFH 100 
'''09:32''' 
* Discovered a gas leak on the fill port on the magnet so gas was turned off. Looking closer the o rings are missing from the fill ports. 
* The O-ring gasket was installed so that O-rings could fall in when inserting the fill tube. 
* We swapped the gasket ring so that they are less likely to fall in. 
'''09:46''' 
* Started N2 gas again and leak is fixed 
* Pressure is 10 PSI and flow is still 100 CFH 
'''09:50'''
* Magnet Pressure is up to .75 PSI now

* Flow rate tops out the flowmeter
'''10:45'''
* Pressure in the magnet is now up to 2.8 PSI 
* LN2 is now flowing into the dewar now 
'''11:15''' 
* Pressure in the magnet has leveled off at 2.9 PSI 
'''12:15'''
* New Quench port developed a small leak and some iced fromed on the o ring
* Turned off the N2 gas
* Took the flange off by unscrewing the 3 screws and used a heat gun to melt the ice that had formed on the flange. 
* Flange was put back on and the N2 gas turned back on
* Currently the N2 pressure is 13.5 PSI
'''12:25'''
* Backed the N2 gas pressure to 10PSI
'''12:40'''
* New Quench port developed a small leak and some iced formed on the o ring
* Turned off the N2 gas
* Removed the flange and turned it around to see if that helps
* Magnet pressure got down to 0.5 PSI during the swap
'''12:44'''
* Turn the N2 gas pressure to 10PSI again 
* Flow meter adjusted so that it is 50 to try and keep the magnet pressure around 2 PSI 
'''12:45'''
* Magnet pressure back up to 2PSI
'''12:51'''
* Flow meter adjusted so that it is 25 to try and keep the magnet pressure around 2 PSI 
'''13:10'''
* Magnet is still sitting pretty at 2PSI 
'''15:51'''
* Magnet pressure dropped to 1PSI far side
* N2 gas turned off and will swap to other side
'''16:08'''

* Magnet pressure is back up to 2PSI
'''17:10'''
* First N2 gas cylinder is running low 
* Swapped to a second cylinder
'''19:10'''
* Pressure started to drop in magnet and a whining sound started
* Preparing to detach the N2 and LN2 to prepair for filling with LHe
'''20:00'''
* Started putting LHe into the near side port.
* O rings were put on properly but first shoved up onto the fill tube so they would not fall in. 
* The LHe dewar was lifted so we could track the weight using a scale. 
* 1" Pressure relief 5PSI valve was taken off to allow gas to He to vent unimpeded. 
* We tried using the 4PSI heater setting on the HE dewar but it didn't seem to work so we switch the to 8PSI setting which seemed good.
* Plume that formed out of the stack relief port was -196 C. 
'''21:47'''
* The first LHe dewar has been emptied.
* Fill ports were capped off and sealed with the bar. 
* 1" 5PSI relief valve was put back on 
* Flow was adjusted so that about 90% of the flow is over the shield and 10% is over the stack. 
* Flowmeter is showing 35 LPM LHE. 
* Magnet PSI is up to 2.5 PSI.

'''10:32'''
* Hooked up the second LHe Dewar to near side 
* Removed the stack relief 5PSI valve. 
* Started putting in more LHE
* This Dewar seems to regulate the 4PSI setting correctly so we are using that
'''10:54'''
* Level reading has reached 110 after adding ~30 lbs from the dewar
* Shortly after the magnet was full 
* We removed the LHe fill lines and capped off the fill holes
* 5PSI stack relief valve was put back on and the flow pushed onto the stack and shield again
'''14:49'''
* Still monitoring the flow and temps of the magnet 
* The shield temperature is still dropping however slowly 
'''16:10'''
*David left to get supplies to make an adapter for the magnet power supply 
'''16:30'''
*Adjusted the flow so it is more over the shield. It is currently stack .3 and shield 13.
'''17:20''' 
* Switch to absolute pressure relief valve 15.7 PSIA instead of relative 1PSI.
'''17:45'''
* David is back with power goodies.
* Going to make the cable for the Magnet power supply. 
'''18:15'''
* David's cable was a rousing success 
* The Magnet power supply us plugged in and turned on 
* Going to spend the rest of the night setting up sensors to be read automatically.  
'''21:48'''

*Arrived 
* Magnet still looks good and pressure was still around 2.5 PSI 
* Shield temp has gone up a little over night 

'''10:20'''
* Extracted Current leads a little to see if it effects the boil off rate. 
* The leads were extracted up until the copper part of the lead started showing
* Starting to clean up everything around the lab that has accumulated over the last 2 days

'''12:50'''
* Pushed current leads back in. Having the current leads retracted reduced the boil off rate by < 1 lpm.
* Making sure that system is stable prior to ramping up magnet.

'''17:08'''
*Magnet area has been cleaned up 
*Cameras installed and have SD cards in them

'''17:10''' 
Starting Ramping the Magnet 
'''18:51'''
* Opened 1 psig relief valve isolation on outlet of flow meters to reduce pressure due to current leads.
'''19:20'''
* Charging automatically paused at low sweep limit of 70 A. 
'''19:23'''
